# Run All Tests

Run all project checks: build, unit tests, e2e tests, lint, and i18n validation.

## Steps

1. Run `yarn build` to build the project
2. Run `yarn test` to run Jest unit tests
3. Run `yarn test:e2e` to run Playwright e2e tests
4. Run `yarn test:e2e:ui` to run Playwright e2e UI tests
5. Run `yarn lint` to check for linting errors
6. Run `yarn lint:i18n` to validate i18n usage

Run all commands and report results in a summary table showing pass/fail status for each check.
